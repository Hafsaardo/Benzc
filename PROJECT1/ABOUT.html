	    	GOTTLIEB DAIMLER CREATED THE FIRST MOTORCYCLE, UNINTENTIONALLY 
	    </h2>
	    <p class="p">
	    	Gottlieb Daimler, a German engineer best known as the creator of compact, high-speed combustion engines and the founding fathers of today’s Daimler AG unintentionally developed the first motorcycle. Among all other Mercedes-Benz facts, this has to be the most interesting one. 
	    </p>
        <p>
	        In 1885, Daimler developed a one-cylinder, vertical engine powered by gasoline. He then stuck the engine into a wooden frame based on a bicycle. The machine was known as the “Daimler Reitwagen” in German (meaning riding wagon) or “Einspur” (single track). Today, it is considered one of the first true motorcycles.

	    	MERCEDES-BENZ INTRODUCED THE FIRST PETROL CAR TO THE WORLD
	    </h2>
	    <img src="image2.jpg" style="width: 700px; height: 500px;">
	    <p>
	    	Karl Benz invented the very first petrol car in the world. In 1886, he patented his three-wheeled automobile powered by petrol– the “Motoragen”. Later on Benz’s wife, Bertha took the car out for a 130-mile tour ride through Germany along with their two sons. This was the first-ever world road trip, a 954-cc single-piston car comprising a four-stroke engine huffing a scorching 0.9 hp – which was very powerful for that time. Among other interesting Mercedes facts like being the creator of the world’s first automobile, Karlz Benz was the first person in the world to get a driver’s licence.

	    <h2>
	    	MERCEDES-BENZ INTRODUCED A HYBRID VEHICLE IN 1906
	    </h2>
	    <p>Before engines powered by pure petrol took over, car companies played with a mix of electric- and gasoline-powered vehicles. An interesting Mercedes-Benz fact is that the Mercedes-Benz Mixte model was the car maker’s first true hybrid. 
        </p>
        <p>
	    The model had a gas engine in front with a dynamo that sparked the two motors in the rear hubs. The Mixte model apparently claimed a top speed of 75 mph.
